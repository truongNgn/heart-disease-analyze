# Heart Disease Prediction

This project applies machine learning models to the **Heart Disease Dataset** in order to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes.  
The notebook covers preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
- Perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** on patient health attributes.  
- Preprocess and normalize data where needed.  
- Build and compare ML classification models.  
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data processing  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heart-disease.git
cd heart-disease
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook heart-disease.ipynb
```

## 📊 Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression** – baseline model.  
- **Decision Tree Classifier** – interpretable approach.  
- **Random Forest Classifier** – ensemble method for improved accuracy.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – distance-based classifier.  
- Other models may also be included.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Evaluation metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.  
- Confusion matrix visualization for classification performance.  
- Feature importance charts to understand influential medical factors.
